          <p class="home-paragraph-1">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese is a language full of history, culture and opportunities. It
            was used by an ancient and glorious civilization — characters are
            the oldest writing system still in use — as well has become the
            official language of one of the most powerful and influential
            economies in the world today and in future. It is the official
            language of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan and one of the
            four official languages of Singapore, while also being spoken in
            Hong Kong, Macao, Vietnam and around the world.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese is a singular language which has influenced other Asian
            tongues like Japanese and Korean. It's special because it mixed
            tones, characters and wide amount of words to learn by heart if you
            wanto to be able to read, write and speak.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese Mandarin speakers are close to the number of 1.2 billion,
            globally we are talking about an astonishing 20% of the human
            population. Let us picture this: with English and Mandarin, you
            would be able to speak with half of the world's population.
            Moreover, as China's economic power grows, Mandarin has made himself
            a place in the international world as the global language of
            business and trades, even if it is one of the most difficult to learn.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese is also one of the 6 official UN languages – the others
            being English, Arabic, French, Russian and Spanish. Chinese is also
            the fastest growing language in the world.
